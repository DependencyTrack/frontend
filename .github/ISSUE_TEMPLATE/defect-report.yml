      Thank you for helping us in making Dependency-Track better!

      **Is the defect you'd like to report *not* specifically UI related?**
      Please create an issue in the [main repository](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/new/choose) instead!
      Unsure? That's fine, just report it in the main repo! The maintainers will migrate the issue if necessary.

      **Please do not ask questions here!**
      If you're not sure whether what you're experiencing is in fact a defect,
      you can reach out to maintainers and the broader community via various channels.
      Refer to our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#asking-questions) to find out where and how to ask questions.
